                                        <b>Company:</b> NextGenTek, Inc. (USA)

                                        Since 1997 I have been heavily involved in SQL database
development. The last three years almost exclusively as a Win32/SQL
Server developer. Most of that development work was done in ODBC. While
ODBC is a powerful tool for application work, it is tedious, highly
error prone, and time consuming to use. During a brief programming
assignment with JAVA, I became familiar with JDBC. I was unhappy that a
similar kind of API set was not available to C++ programmers. Then by
great fortune I discovered SQLAPI and realized that it was just what I
had been looking for.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In June of 2001, my company began a project to develop
a major voice mail / unified messaging product that would have an
extensive SQL Server database component supporting both the Win32 GUI
and many NT service programs.&nbsp; SQLAPI was chosen as the
development tool for the database interface. After nine months of
programming using SQLAPI, I wonder how I ever got along without it. I
would never consider going back to ODBC and with SQLAPI's multi
platform support, I won't have to.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I have been purchasing software development tools for
more than 25 years and I can say that the customer support from SQLAPI
has been excellent with quick, informative responses to my questions. I
have no reservations about strongly recommending SQLAPI to any
developer involved in database application work no matter what the
platform or the database product.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
After using SQLAPI for 15 years, I still believe it to be the best database interface library available. 
                                    As CTO, my company's telephony services platform grew significantly in both scope and complexity over that period.
                                    Just prior to my recent retirement, this platform was serving more than 125,000 users.
                                    It started day-one using SQLAPI for all of its SQL Server database access and it still does.
                                    It would not surprise me if that platform ran for another 10 years - the SQLAPI license 
                                        was the most cost effective software investment I ever made.  I simply cannot imagine writing a complex database app without using SQLAPI.</p>

                                        I first discovered SQLAPI++ in early 2001 when
searching for an easy way to add ODBC and SQL capabilities to the
applications that Retail Technologies Corporation develops.&nbsp;At the
time, I has been learning exactly how painful and tedious it is to
write native ODBC code myself, and I knew that that had to be a better
way of doing things.&nbsp; An additional consideration at the time was
future portability of our current Windows applications to Linux in the
future. SQLAPI++ has served both of these needs very well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        SQLAPI++ provides a very well thought out C++ class
library for database access, offering not just ODBC, but native access
to just about all major databases.&nbsp; Additionally, SQLAPI++ is
available for both the Windows and Linux platforms - with source code
included.&nbsp; Using SQLAPI++, I have been able to take advantage of
SQL (and ODBC) with much less programming effort than might have
otherwise been required. This has helped reduce the time to market for
the products that I am developing.&nbsp; Furthermore, I have found the
technical support and customer service to be second to none.&nbsp;Any
time that I have run into issues or had questions, I have found the
staff at SQLAPI++ to be very responsive, always willing to go that
extra mile to help.

SQL Databases using a universal approach. Previously we had to use
various different mechanisms to access databases. The library has
proved itself on both Windows and UNIX platforms to be well written,
easy to use and stable.

                                        I have never found a better API to use to access the
databases my customers use and me. The API is very simple to use and it
doesn't matter if you're using MS SQL, Oracle or some other RDBMS. You
will get up and running really fast. This one is great. I highly
recommend this to anyone that needs to access an RDBMS.

product is responsible for minimizing the support load on our
development folks for our product that formerly used the Oracle Pro*c
precompiler. This enabled us to have less worry about which Oracle
client the customer is using, and allowed us to support Oracle and MS
SQL Server successfully with a single code base. I highly recommend it
for C++ development efforts.

to easily connect to any SQL Server database within the intra-net and
perform all of my database transactions including queries, updates,

                                        Few years ago I developed a program for loading fairly
complex data into Oracle. I used C++ and RogueWave's DBtools.h++ on
Solaris. A couple of years later I had to modify the program, and found
out I had to re-purchase DBtools.h++ because of lapsed maintenance
fees. After looking around, I found out that SQLAPI++ was a lot less
expensive, so I switched. But the best part was that the interface was
much cleaner. Using RogueWave, I had to "bounce" the data between C++
and RogueWave's classes, before I could pass it on to SQL. SQLAPI++
eliminated all this burden.

                                        I was under an extremely tight development schedule to
deliver an application to call and retrieve results from Oracle
packages. Without enough time to write my own handlers, I knew a third
party library would be necessary. I researched a number of different
libraries and SQLAPI++ had everything I needed at, what I realize now
after using it, a phenomenal price. Integration into our project was
simple, support was fantastic, and performance was unbeatable. SQLAPI++
delivered! Thank You!

                                        I found SQLAPI++ searching the web for a solution to
connect to MySQL and, optionally, to other databases. SQLAPI++ is
really easy to use, quickly to get started with and worked right away.
I was astonished!

                                        SQLAPI++ is clean, easy to use and has well thought out
class library for database access.
We tested it out on our applications with Oracle and Sybase on Windows
and Linux platform,
and it runs really well. We are able to deploy our application to any
of our customers without deployment license. Also, SQLAPI++ has
knowledgeable technical support and the response time
is excellent. I highly recommend this software. Great work!<br>

                                        We were looking for an
API to DB access with the following requirements:<br>
                                        - Native C++ language.<br>
                                        - Win32 and Linux support.<br>
                                        - Several DB support.<br>
                                        - Easy to use.<br>
                                        And we found it! We dediced to acquire SQLAPI++ after deep test with
demo version.
It's stable, fast and it's really easy to learn how to use it.
